/**
 * queue_t defines a queue of pointers.
 *
 * The following diagram illustrates a queue with capacity 3. The
 * internal capacity is increaded by 1 in order to prevent the start
 * pointer from overtaking the end pointer.
 *
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 *   ^           ^
 *   start       end
 *   first
 *   last
 *   reading
 *   writing
 *
 * The following explains the changes performed by a evr_queue_put
 * call on the queue. First the internal writing target pointer is
 * calculated. As w = writing + 1.
