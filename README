------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build

On linux you can execute the following within the everarch directory
to build the application.

Setup the build system once after you clone the repository:

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure

Run every time you want to build the application:

$ make


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests

Build the application and then exectute the following to run the whole
test suite:

$ ./test.sh

Test execution relies on valgrind ( https://www.valgrind.org ).

The following steps should be performed when adding new tests. We
assume a test for x.h/x.c should be added.

Create a file which should contain the tests beside x.c with the name
x-test.c. Add a main function which tests x.h and x.c.

Add the test program to src/Makefile.am.
