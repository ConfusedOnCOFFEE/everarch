podman and everarch

This directory contains some hints how to run everarch within podman
and some scripts for building everarch images for podman.

If your build system is amd64 you should install the following:

$ apt install podman podman-compose buildah qemu-user-static qemu-system-arm

The evr-glacier-storage and evr-websocket-server directories contain
build scripts which generate podman images.

The standalone-glacier-websocket directory contains a podman-compose
configuration for starting a evr-glacier-storage and
evr-websocket-server container.
