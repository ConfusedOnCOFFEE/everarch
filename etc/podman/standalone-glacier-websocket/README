standalone glacier and websocket

This directory contains a podman-compose (or docker-compose)
configuration for starting a complete evr-glacier-storage and
evr-websocket-server environment.

To start the standalone environment run:

$ podman-compose up

The evr-websocket-server will be available at ws://localhost:8030

The user for the evr-websocket-server will be kim and the password is
randomly generated and written to the
standalone-glacier-websocket_conf volume. You can retrieve the
password by executing the following commands:

$ podman unshare
$ podman volume mount standalone-glacier-websocket_conf

Then cd into the directory that the previous mount command printed on
the screen.

$ cat evr-websocket-server.conf.json

Now you should see the evr-websocket-server configuration which
contains the password for the user kim.
