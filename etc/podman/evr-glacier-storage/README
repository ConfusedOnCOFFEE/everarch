evr-glacier-storage podman build

This directory contains the files for building a podman image which
runs an evr-glacier-storage server. The convenient thing about this
image is the startup process which automatically creates TLS
certificates and random passwords for you.

For building the image first build everarch within an alpine
linux. The build instructions for alpine linux are in
../../../doc/BUILD.alpine.

Then copy the built evr-glacier-storage binary into this
directory. After that you can build the podman image:

$ ./build

The built image will be tagged evr-glacier-storage and will reference
two volumes. The /pub volume will be populated with the TLS
certificate of the instance and the evr-glacier-storage auth
token. You will need these files if you want to connect to the
evr-glacier-storage instance.
