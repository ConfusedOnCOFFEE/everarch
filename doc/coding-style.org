* Everarch Coding Style
The prophet gave us the [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html][Kernel Coding Style]] to which you should stick.

But of course just like in nature new religions evolve in the human
species and so do coding styles. So we get rid of the inconsistencies.

** put the opening { in functions in the same line
Here is a good example:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
function int foo() {
  return 42;
}
#+END_SRC
