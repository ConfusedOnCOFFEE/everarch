The tls directory contains TLS public/private key pairs which must
only be used for unit and integration test.

If you need to create your own key pair you can use the following
command:

$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha512 -nodes -out my-cert.pem -keyout my-key.pem

Add the option '-days 17800' for generating insecure certificates for
integration testing.

You can analyze the contents of an existing certificate using the
following command:

$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in attr-index-cert.pem
