 * configp.h declares a configuration file parser which takes nearly
 * the same arguments as argp.h. The idea is to declare your command
 * line arguments for argp, do a little wrapping and also have a
 * configuration file parser.
 *
 * There are some differences to argp you should notice:
 * - ARGP_KEY_ARG arguments are not supported.
 * - parser has one extra argument which would be argp_usage if you were
 *   called by argp.
 * - every property of argp_state must not be accessed in the parser
 *   call except: input
