* index the ref attribute of claims in attr-index
a claim can reference an original claim via it's ref attribute. these
references should be inexed.

this index should be used to lookup all claims which reference the
same original claim.
* store the created attr timestamp for claim-sets in attr-index
so a temporal order of claims-sets and claims can be created.
* add a attr-index cmd to lookup all claims for a given claim ref
* apply the name 'seed' to claims which are referenced by a ref attr
this is probably the case in claims. maybe we should call the ref attr
seed instead? and index-ref should be called index-seed?

the following places should be checked for renamings:
** README
** claims.[hc]
** doc/claims/*.xml
* implement contains operator in attr queries
the contains operator should be the tilde. for example: title~peng.
* evr-attr-index must collect counts of seen claims
evr-attr-index must collect the element name and namespace of every
seen claims from the raw claim sets. the counts should be stored in
the index db.

there must be a command in the evr-attr-index search interface to
query the counts.

this feature should make it easier to gain an insight on the indexed
claims. mostly i want the feature to validate the attr-index works as
expected.

it also might help finding out which transformations should further be
added to the transformation xslt.
* count of seen claims should be queryable via attr-index cmd
* implement t in attr queries
tag=todo t=12345
tag=todo t=1970-01-01T00:00:07Z
* implement offset and limit in attr queries
tag=todo offset=0 limit=100
* add ref key to attr query language to match ref
introduce ref as keyword to match the ref of a claim. later "ref" (in
double quotes) should mean the attribute with the key ref.
* add boolean or operator to attr query language
#+BEGIN_SRC
(tag=todo || tag=backlog) && tag=howto
#+END_SRC
* add braces to attr query language
#+BEGIN_SRC
(tag=todo || tag=backlog) && tag=howto
#+END_SRC
* add not operator to attr query language
#+BEGIN_SRC
!tag=nsfw
#+END_SRC
* make evr-glacier-storage port configurable
* make evr-attr-index port configurable
* store flags and blob size redundant in buckets
right now flags and blob size in the evr-glacier-storage are storend
once for every blob and without any checksum.

there should be either a checksum for the two fields or it should be
stored redundant. this should reduce the risk of breaking a whole
bucket if one blob in it has a bit error.
* migrate tcp sockets to tls
remove the unencrypted tcp ports and only allow tls secured tcp
connections.
* add authentication
think of some kind of authentication for the network sockets and
implement it.
* make accepted gpg keys for verfification configurable
right now the blob signature verification accepts all valid gpg
keys. we only want to accept certain gpg keys which are probably our
own.

also the gpg public keys should be stored in the storage as
blobs. that way they should never be lost. the configuration should
reference the gpg keys sha3-224 hashes.
* add claim-ref type in attr-spec's attr-def
add a new type which tells the attr-index to expect a reference to a
claim as value. attr-index should check if the value is parseable
using evr_parse_claim_ref(â€¦).
* ---- v0.1 boundary ----
everything above will be part of the first release of everarch. first
release means i will personally use it in production as mirror of my
perkeep stuff.
* add match functions to attr query language
#+BEGIN_SRC
tag=todo && is_image(mime_type)
#+END_SRC
* report ref and some attributes specified by key in attr querries
the query might be something like: select title where tag=todo
* make boolean and operator '&&' optional in attr query language
#+BEGIN_SRC
(tag=todo || tag=backlog) tag=howto
#+END_SRC
* gracefully handle sqlite database is locked in evr-glacier-storage
sqlite's step function will exit with SQLITE_LOCKED if a table is
locked for more than 1sec (configured right now).

a SQLITE_LOCKED error should be indicated as 'resource temporary not
available' to the client.
* gracefully handle sqlite database is locked in evr-attr-index
sqlite's step function will exit with SQLITE_LOCKED if a table is
locked for more than 1sec (configured right now).

a SQLITE_LOCKED error should be indicated as 'resource temporary not
available' to the client.
* add quic support
in order to get faster connection building and encryption.

the most interesting quic library to use right now would be [[https://github.com/microsoft/msquic][msquic]]
because it depends just on OpenSSL. OpenSSL with downstream patches
unfortunately. there are [[https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/12/03/starting-the-quic-design/][plans by the OpenSSL team]] to add quic
support.
* replace struct chunk_set with linked list
dny-mem.h should provide one growable random access data structure and
one growable linked list data structure.

especially struct dynamic_array is not very well fitted for growing
because of the evr_chunk_set_max_chunks limitation.

struct dynamic_array should be renamed to hint the random access
usage. maybe rabuf instead of dynamic_array and llbuf for chunk_set.

pitrp also suggests to copy the XARRAY or X_ARRAY implementation from
the linux kernel.

linked list chunk sizes maybe should be aligned with RLIMIT_FSIZE. see
[[elisp:(manual-entry "setrlimit(2)")][setrlimit(2)]] for retrieving RLIMIT_FSIZE and limit the chunk size
regarding to it. also the chunk size should not grow over 1MB.

there should also be a function for writing linked lists to a file
descriptor using writev.
* use writev instead of buf copying
writev can write mutliple buffers in one system call. this may reduce
the amout of memory being copied before a write call. there are
probably some places in glacier.c and the networking code which can
benefit from writev.
* introduce scripted transformations
attr specs should also support scripts which perform the claim
transformations instead of just xslt stylesheets.

a new transformation could look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<attr-spec>
  <attr-def k="tag" type="str"/>
  <transformation type="bin" blob="sha3-224-00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"/>
</attr-spec>
#+END_SRC

the transformation would point to an executable elf binary, shell or
python script.
* allow attr query args in quotes
#+BEGIN_SRC
'the key'='the value'
"the key"="the value"
#+END_SRC
* get rid of double _ in defines
as they are not intended for userspace. mentioned by pitrp.
* analyze and maybe replace own queues with lib io_uring
inter thread communitcation queues have been implemented in struct
evr_work_watch_ctx and struct evr_persister_ctx.

for the sake of using well tested code we should check migrating our
own queues to lib io_uring. mentioned by pitrp.
* implement an evr-glacier-storage blob put/get benchmark
should connect via network socket. send lots of blobs. request lots of
blobs. count blobs per second. maybe different blob sizes etc.
* create bucket directory if not existing :bdircre:
* repair out of sync bucket end pointer and file end offset :beprep:
the whole bucket should be scanned with validation of each key and
blob. if the file probably ends with one corrupt blob it should be
discarded.

it's important to be sensible about the discarded data at the end of
the file. maybe there should be an 'autorepair' flag in the
configuration.
