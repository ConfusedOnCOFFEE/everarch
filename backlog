* remove typedefs for atomic types
see [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html][kernel coding style]] section 5b
* rename structs from X_t to X
pitrp said only the committe uses _t suffix.
* function body opening braces in new lines
* evr-glacier-cli application with put blob feature
* add get blob feature to evr-glacier-cli
* actually process commands using glacier
* implement an integration test / benchmark
should connect via network socket. send lots of blobs. request lots of
blobs. count blobs per second. maybe different blob sizes etc.
* align chunk size with RLIMIT_FSIZE
see [[elisp:(manual-entry "setrlimit(2)")][setrlimit(2)]] for retrieving RLIMIT_FSIZE and limit the chunk size
regarding to it. also the chunk size should not grow over 1MB.
* create bucket directory if not existing :bdircre:
* repair out of sync bucket end pointer and file end offset :beprep:
the whole bucket should be scanned with validation of each key and
blob. if the file probably ends with one corrupt blob it should be
discarded.

it's important to be sensible about the discarded data at the end of
the file. maybe there should be an 'autorepair' flag in the
configuration.
